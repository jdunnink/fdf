A relatively simple 3d map rastizer. The program is able to receive a map of 3d coordinates, which it will then display. The object can
be viewed from different angles using the displayed commands.

- Compile fdf by running the Makefile in the root of this repository, currently only tested on OS X.
- Run the program with ./fdf [map], examples are included within the test_maps directory.
